Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
1.	Ask the user for n and nth
2.	Divide the n by nth
3.	Check whether the number is divisible by 2 or not
4.	If it is print even otherwise print odd
5.	You get the result
